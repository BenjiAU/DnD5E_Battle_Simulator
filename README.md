# DnD5E_Battle_Simulator

A fun script that simulates a bunch of different combat elements in a mock DnD 5E battle - inspired by the "Percy vs Grog" theorycrafting that has run amok since the Skull incident.

Notes:
* I haven't used python for a long time, and I'm still struggling with basic concepts like namespaces and modules; hence why all of the code is in one giant file. If you can explain to me how to separate the class definitions and body of the code into separate, neat modules without having a ton of 'import X' statements everywhere I'd love to hear it!
* I created a new Python Web Application for the purposes of GitHub (this was originally a console app) - eventually I intend for this to be able to function on a public website and allow users to select combatants/details as input, but for now executing the script is sufficient to get the output
* Output will be generated to C:\stuff\combatlog_<timestamp>, no directory identification or customisation is present; edit the path if you want to output to a different file
